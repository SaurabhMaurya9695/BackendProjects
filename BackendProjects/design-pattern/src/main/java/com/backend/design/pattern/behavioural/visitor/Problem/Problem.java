/**
 * ‚ùå Problem Explanation:
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * This code violates several SOLID principles:
 * <p>
 * 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Open/Closed Principle (OCP) Violation**
 * - The `FileVisitor` interface is not closed for modification.
 * - If we need to add a new operation like `encrypt()`, `preview()`, or `extractMetadata()`,
 * we must modify this interface and then also modify *all* implementing classes (`Text`, `Pdf`, etc.).
 * - Hence, existing classes must be changed whenever a new operation is added.
 * <p>
 * 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) Violation**
 * - Both `Text` and `Pdf` classes are forced to implement *all* methods of the interface
 * even if some of them are irrelevant for that class (e.g., `compress()` for `Text` files may not make sense).
 * - This creates a "fat interface" ‚Äî one that forces clients to depend on methods they do not use.
 * <p>
 * 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Violation**
 * - The `FileVisitor` interface handles multiple responsibilities ‚Äî size calculation, compression, etc.
 * - Any change to one responsibility affects all classes implementing it.
 * - As a result, there is tight coupling and low cohesion.
 * <p>
 * üí° In short:
 * - Every time a new behavior is added, you modify existing code.
 * - This breaks modularity and flexibility.
 * <p>
 * ‚úÖ Correct Approach (using Visitor Pattern):
 * - Define separate "visitor" objects that can be applied to different file types.
 * - Allows new operations (visitors) to be added without changing file classes.

/**
