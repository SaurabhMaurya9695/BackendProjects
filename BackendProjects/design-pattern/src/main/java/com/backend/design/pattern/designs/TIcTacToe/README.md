## 🎨 Design Patterns Used

### 1. Strategy Pattern
- **Interface**: `WinStrategy`
- **Implementation**: `StandardWinStrategy`
- **Purpose**: Allows different win conditions to be plugged in
- **Benefit**: Can easily add diagonal-only wins, 4-in-a-row, etc.

### 2. Observer Pattern
- **Interface**: `GameObserver`
- **Subject**: `TicTacToeGame` implements `GameSubject`
- **Observer**: `ConsoleGameObserver`
- **Purpose**: Notifies players about game events
- **Benefit**: Easy to add GUI notifications, sound effects, etc.

### 3. Value Object Pattern
- **Classes**: `Symbol`, `Move`
- **Purpose**: Immutable objects representing values
- **Benefit**: Thread-safe, no unintended mutations

### 4. Factory Method Pattern
- **Location**: `Client.java` factory methods
- **Purpose**: Creates game components
- **Benefit**: Centralized object creation, easy to modify

## ✅ SOLID Principles Adherence

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ✅
Each class has ONE clear responsibility:
- `Board` - Manages board state
- `Player` - Manages player identity
- `TicTacToeGame` - Manages game flow
- `GameController` - Handles user I/O
- `ConsoleGameObserver` - Displays notifications
- `StandardWinStrategy` - Checks win conditions

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP) ✅
- Open for extension via `WinStrategy` interface
- Can add new observers without modifying game logic
- Can add new player types without changing existing code

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) ✅
- Any `WinStrategy` implementation can be used
- Any `GameObserver` implementation works correctly
- Interfaces are properly designed

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) ✅
- `WinStrategy` - focused on win checking only
- `GameObserver` - specific game event methods
- `GameSubject` - only observer management
- No "fat" interfaces

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) ✅
- `TicTacToeGame` depends on `WinStrategy` interface, not concrete class
- Observers are injected, not created internally
- All dependencies are passed via constructor (Dependency Injection)

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed from Original Code

| # | Bug | Original Code | Fixed Code |
|---|-----|---------------|------------|
| 1 | **Invalid position check** | `return arr.length <= r && arr[1].length <= c;` | `return row >= 0 && row < rows && col >= 0 && col < cols;` |
| 2 | **Anti-diagonal check** | Checked same as main diagonal | Fixed to use `(i, n-i-1)` |
| 3 | **Type mismatch** | Compared `Symbol` with `String` | Use `Symbol.equals(Symbol)` |
| 4 | **Game loop logic** | Fixed r,c in while loop | Proper input reading inside loop |
| 5 | **isValidMove inverted** | Returned true when occupied | Fixed logic |
| 6 | **Draw check wrong** | Just inverted win check | Check if board is full AND no winner |
| 7 | **Missing equals()** | Symbol used default equals | Added proper `equals()` and `hashCode()` |

## 🚀 How to Run

### Compile
```bash
cd design-pattern
mvn clean compile
```

### Run
```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.backend.design.pattern.designs.TIcTacToe.Client"
```

Or from your IDE, run `Client.java`

---

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Game starts with Player 1 (X)
2. Enter row number (0-2)
3. Enter column number (0-2)
4. Board updates automatically
5. **Opponent gets notified** on every move ⭐
6. Game detects wins or draws automatically
7. Option to play again and track scores

### Sample Game
```
   0  1  2 
0 | X | _ | _ | 
1 | _ | O | _ | 
2 | _ | _ | X | 

Player 2's turn (O)
[NOTIFICATION] Player 2, it's your turn now!
```

## 🔧 Extensibility Examples

### Add a New Win Strategy
```java
public class DiagonalOnlyWinStrategy implements WinStrategy {
    @Override
    public boolean checkWin(Board board, Symbol symbol) {
        // Only check diagonals
        return checkDiagonals(board, symbol);
    }
}

// Use it in Client.java
private static WinStrategy createWinStrategy() {
    return new DiagonalOnlyWinStrategy();
}
```

### Add Email Notifications
```java
public class EmailGameObserver implements GameObserver {
    @Override
    public void onMoveMade(Move move, Player opponent) {
        sendEmail(opponent.getEmail(), "Your turn!");
    }
    // ... implement other methods
}

// Attach in Client.java
game.attach(new EmailGameObserver());
```

### Add Different Board Sizes
```java
// 4x4 board
private static Board createBoard() {
    return new Board(4, 4);
}
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Test Example
```java
@Test
public void testPlayerWinsRow() {
    Board board = new Board(3);
    Player p1 = new Player("Test", new Symbol('X'));
    WinStrategy strategy = new StandardWinStrategy();
    
    board.makeMove(0, 0, p1.getSymbol());
    board.makeMove(0, 1, p1.getSymbol());
    board.makeMove(0, 2, p1.getSymbol());
    
    assertTrue(strategy.checkWin(board, p1.getSymbol()));
}
```
